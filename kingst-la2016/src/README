The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

This is a Free/Libre/Open-source firmware for the cypress fx2 mcu
used in the Kingst la2016 and la1016 logic analyzers. This firmware
is used along with the libsigrok driver 'kingst-la2016'.


Status
------

Tested with PulseView on the Kingst la2016 and la1016.


Requirements
------------

 - git
 - make
 - autoconf >= 2.63
 - automake >= 1.11
 - sdcc (>= 3.4.0)


Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to get the source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-firmware
 $ cd sigrok-firmware/kingst-la2016/src
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

For installing:

 $ make install

The generated *.fw file is installed into /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware

You can override the install location like this:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

See INSTALL or the following wiki page for more (OS-specific) instructions:

Pre-built firmware file
-----------------------

There is also a pre-built firmware file that can be used without having
to build from source. It is available in the sigrok-firmware repository.


fx2lib
------

The fx2lafw code uses a (slightly modified) "fx2lib" helper library.

It was imported into fx2lafw from

  git://github.com/ubixum/fx2lib.git

as of Feb 12, 2012 (git hash "416c104cbd").

The following files/directories were removed, as they're not needed
for our purposes: CHANGELOG, COPYING*, docs/, examples/, fw/, and utils/.
