README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sigrok project aims at creating a portable, cross-platform,
Free/Libre/Open-Source signal analysis software suite that supports various
device types (such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and more).

sigrok-firmware is a collection of firmware files required for some of the
devices libsigrok supports (logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or others).

We only carry firmware files for which we have an explicit permission/license
that allows at _least_ redistribution of the firmware.


Status
------

sigrok-firmware is in a usable state and has had official tarball releases.


Building and installing
-----------------------

In order to get the sigrok-firmware source code and build it, run:

 $ git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-firmware
 $ cd sigrok-firmware
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make

For installing sigrok-firmware:

  $ make install

This will install the files into /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware per default.

You can override the install directory like this:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

See INSTALL or the following wiki page for more (OS-specific) instructions:
